### Trunk Based Development

Refs:

#### Summary

A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called "trunk" (master or main),
resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They
therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build.

Very small teams can commit direct to the trunk. 
At scale is best done with short-lived feature branches (max couple of days)
