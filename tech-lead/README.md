High impact, low commitment 

(L0) task to stay in touch - walking the code - make observations 

refactoring towards design (L1)

MRs if you move fast (focus on test strategy) 

High cost with big impact - full architectural refactor(s) - use core hours for this

dev ops tasks

productivity multipliers (e.g. dev ops related, onboarding where needed - new members, training others like current members) 

dedicate time to stay relevant (learn about redux toolkit, learn on repository pattern, micro frontends) -    1hr every day?

protect your time (look at the Tech Lead schedule as a ref) negotiate blocks of time to do your job
