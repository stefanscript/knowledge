### Passes the tests
The most important rule, the primary goal is that the software works as intended.

### Reveals intent
The code should be easy to understand. According to Extreme Programing communication is a core value. 
The code that you write will be read by people and they should understand it.

### No duplication
"eliminating duplication is a powerful way to drive out good design".

### Fewest elements
Anything that doesn't serve the above rules should be removed.
